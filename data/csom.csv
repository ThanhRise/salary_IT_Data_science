to join our dynamic team!
The ideal candidate will have a proven track record in integrating diverse systems, implementing robust data strategies, and a solid understanding of the Vista database.

This role interfaces with multiple teams & projects -
we’re eager to meet our newest team member!
JH Kelly, LLC is a fourth-generation, family-owned regional construction company in its 100th year with offices in Vancouver, Longview, Seattle, Bellingham, Washington, and Milwaukie, Oregon. We provide services to a commercial and heavy industrial client base and are recognized as an industry leader.
Our exceptional team is made up of talented individuals whose ability to plan and execute challenging projects has resulted in a loyal customer following and national safety & quality control awards. Our integrated project approach includes self-performing concrete placement, steel erection, carpentry, equipment setting, millwrighting, plumbing, pipefitting, sheet metal, electrical & instrumentation services, and servicing the completed building.
JH Kelly is a great place to work in a fun, dynamic, and family-oriented environment. We offer an excellent benefits package and competitive wages. Learn more about us at www.jhkelly.com
Summary:
The rapid evolution of technology offers exciting opportunities for individuals seeking challenging and meaningful careers. Conversely, it’s no secret that careers in this field are sometimes associated with isolation, silos, and the risk of hitting dead ends.
At JH Kelly, we approach technology differently. Rather than developing products for sale, we are integrating our systems along a robust data strategy to drive faster and more profitable business decisions. We are the customer. As such, we challenge our teams to diversify their skill sets and follow their passions, firmly believing that people who are doing what they are genuinely interested in are more innovative than those toiling away in obscurity on one small part of a larger project.
At the core of our data strategy is our ERP, Vista by Viewpoint. We utilize SQL, SSIS, SSAS, and Tabular Editor to extract data from Vista and our propriety Project Control System to create the core of our Data Warehouse. From that, we leverage Power BI not only to create a traditional look-back reporting but to aggregate our data “over time” and project the future outcome of our Construction Projects. Our vision is to combine information from our Safety, Estimating, Design, and Supply Chain platforms with this data, in a Data Lake, providing end-to-end visibility on all primary processes within our Construction Operations.
Joining the JH Kelly team requires a dynamic and proactive mindset. As part of our Development Team, you will be directly interacting with our C-Suite on iterative projects, proof of concepts, and multi-year road maps. You will be challenged with complex problems with the freedom to develop solutions. You will work closely with our cross-functional Development Teams to design, develop, and maintain data pipelines, models, and analytics solutions that serve our Operational Teams.

Perform data analysis, data cleansing, and data transformation as needed.
Ensure data quality and accuracy through data validation and testing.
Create and implement data governance policies and best practices.
Stay up-to-date with industry trends and emerging technologies in data engineering and data science.
Qualifications:
Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Data Science, or a related field.
Proven experience as a Data Engineer, Data Scientist, or similar role.
Proficiency in Vista by Viewpoint and its associated data structures.

Applications Developer,$6K - $13K (Employer est.),"Reporting to the Head of Software Development & Library Systems, the Applications Developer contributes to the technical design and development for all end user applications developed by the UCLA Library. The incumbent works collaboratively with other members of the Software Development unit, as well as with colleagues in the Digital Library Program, and stakeholders in various units across the Library and the Film & Television Archive.

The Software Developer is a member of the Software Development & Library Systems (SDLS) unit. The SDLS unit is comprised of 10 Software Developers, 3 Sysadmins, and 2 UX Designers, who are grouped into three development sub-teams: 1) the Applications Team, which builds end-user applications, 2) the Services Team, which builds backend services and APIs used by internal and external applications; 3) the Systems Team, which builds internal applications and middleware, manages COTS systems, and performs experimental projects. In addition to the four development sub-teams, SDLS also includes the Dev Support Team (systems administrators) and the UX Team. Members from those two groups are embedded in the three development teams. The unit follows a Kanban method of Agile development, wherein each sub-team meets weekly for backlog grooming and the entire unit meets for daily standups and monthly retrospectives. The unit strives for a DevOps culture of collaboration, feedback & improvement, and continual learning. Evidence of this culture includes stakeholders participating in backlog grooming and standups, regular monitoring of retrospective action items, and team-wide isolated time for learning and experimentation. The team also embraces a remote-first culture, with permanently remote members across 4 time zones.
The Software Development & Library Systems unit is part of the Digital Initiatives and Information Technology (DIIT) department, which is comprised of over 50 staff members in five functional units: 1) the Software Development Team, as described above, 2) the Core Ops Team, which supports the network and manages the servers and storage in the datacenter, 3) the Core Services Team which provides IT hardware support and enterprise application support to Library staff and lends laptops and other hardware to students, 4) the Data Science Center which provides training, consultation, and a data repository for campus researchers, and 5) the Digital Library Program which works with partners, both internal to UCLA and across the globe, to execute projects that digitize, describe, and publish archival materials.

As a member of the Applications Team, the Applications Developer's primary responsibility is development of public user interfaces, including the main Library website, the Film & Television Archive website, and several Digital Library collection applications. We have multiple legacy applications, primarily built with either Blacklight (Ruby on Rails + Solr) or with Drupal. The team's new stack is Vue.js and Nuxt.js along with ElasticSearch, and content will be migrated into the new applications to consolidate the toolset and the portfolio of supported applications.

The DataViz team collaborates with a variety of partners within Apple to distill data into actionable and intuitive visualizations that drive informed decisions. We work cooperatively to understand challenging problems that arise during all stages of product design at Apple. The job requires collaborative work, fluency using statistics and visualizations to answer specific questions about datasets, proficient programming skills in R or Python, and most importantly, a passion for creating informative visualizations and presentations to communicate results to all levels of the company. We encourage anyone who approaches problem solving with curiosity and imagination to apply. We value people with a desire to learn new skills and a mindset that views challenging questions as opportunities for insight.

Key Qualifications

Key Qualifications


Preferred Qualifications:
No single candidate will come in with all desired qualifications - above all else we’re looking for someone with an eagerness and ability to learn new skills and solve dynamic problems in a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive environment.
Experience programming in R or Python. You have experience using these tools to import, clean, analyze and visualize data to enable data-driven decision making.
Experience using statistics to identify trends and anomalies in multivariate and/or medium-sized datasets using conventional statistical techniques. Our datasets are typically not large enough to employ deep learning techniques.
Experience writing code to generate visualizations that enable deeper insight into data.
Strong interest in peer collaboration and teamwork and a willingness to solicit input and accept feedback.
An appreciation of functional design or interested in developing your design aesthetic.
Excitement and passion to communicate important information in an easily understandable manner.
Worth Mentioning:
The varied nature of the problems our team handles means that there is a lot of room for your other skills to also be of use. We mention this here so you will include them in your resume if present, but they are not required for the role.
Experience analyzing and visualizing 3D data sets or enthusiastic about delving deeper into 3D data analysis and visualization. Our datasets include human anthropometric and biometric data, acoustic data and inertial motion unit data (accelerometers, gyroscopes, altimeters).
Experience using Natural Language Processing to analyze text data or eager to learn more. Our work in this space usually involves topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and interactive visualization of free form text from user studies and surveys.
Experience creating interactive data visualizations using Shiny or d3 + React or a keen interest in building up that part of your skillset.

Isaacson, Miller’s STEM search practice works with a broad range of clients: higher education, independent research institutes, cultural institutions, policy and advocacy organizations, foundations, and biotechnology enterprises. From basic and applied science to computation, IM works to identify leaders who are innovators in their field and adept at steering enterprises and people through times of dynamic change.

Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. – Chief Technology Officer
University of Miami - Executive Director, Frost Institute of Chemistry and Molecular Science
University of California, Davis – Dean, College of Engineering
Illinois Institute of Technology – President; and Dean, Armour College of Engineering
We are currently searching for Associates to join this practice. Although some technical background in science or technology would be helpful, it is not necessary. Rather, a keen interest and deep intellectual curiosity about subjects in science, technology, and their effect on society are all that are needed to serve our clients well.
THE STEM ASSOCIATE ROLE
Associates are talent recruiters, relationship builders, writers, and project managers. They support the project work of Partners who build client relationships, develop business, and ensure the successful and high-quality completion of each search.
Over time, Associates undertake additional responsibility and have the opportunity to progress in the firm and build their own search practices. As Associates continue to expand and grow their competencies, breadth of experience, and level of independence, they can progress to the Senior and Managing Associate levels.
Associates carry several search projects simultaneously, each on its own timeline, and are involved in all stages of the search process. They collaborate with the Partner in developing and executing research and networking strategies, recruiting and screening candidates, conducting candidate references, managing due diligence, overseeing timeframes, and preparing for and participating in client presentations.
Senior Associates have more independent client contact and assume greater responsibility for client and candidate management than Associates. Senior Associates may conduct in-person candidate interviews and have standing to address candidate and client questions and concerns independently throughout the search process. Managing Associates have acquired all search execution skills and effectively manage a search project from start to finish. As they develop a reputation in the market, Managing Associates begin to build the foundation of a search practice, preparing for the next step to Partner.
KEY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE STEM ASSOCIATE
Associates work on matrix teams with a partner and their search coordinator. Upon joining the firm, the Associate will be expected to perform the following tasks:
Scope the position with the client through initial site visits with the Partner to gather essential information, including the nature of the role, the challenges facing the organization, and the client’s ambitions for moving the organization forward. Following the visit, an Associate is generally expected to write, edit, and proofread much of the first draft of the position description.
Develop a deep and diverse pool of candidates through exhaustive research and accurate and persuasive phone and email communications with sources and potential candidates, supported by the use of IM’s proprietary database. In concert with the Partner, an Associate is expected to develop and implement networking strategies for each search, remaining flexible in their approach to ensure appropriate responses to client and market feedback.
Evaluate potential candidates with respect to their organization, industry, and the needs of a particular client. Associates assess candidate credentials, and credibility, both on paper and through in-depth phone interviews. Senior Associates may also conduct longer in-person and/or video interviews with candidates.
Maintain positive relationships with clients and candidates. Every individual with whom we connect is a potential candidate, source, client, or combination of the three. An Associate’s role is heavily oriented toward networking and recruiting, and they are often an individual’s first point of contact with IM. Associates must ensure a positive first impression through courteous and timely correspondence and follow-through. Associates maintain contact with candidates throughout a search, keeping them informed and engaged. In addition, Senior Associates often serve as a point of contact for the client, responding to requests and providing updates.
Present the pool to the client via in-person and virtual meetings. In consultation with the Partner, the Associate drafts memos and supplemental documents and is responsible for the accuracy, clarity, and consistency of the information and materials presented.
Manage the flow of knowledge obtained during a search regarding candidates, sources, and clients by regularly updating the firm’s database. In addition, Associates must routinely brief Partners on the overall progress of a search, market feedback, and individual candidate situations. Alongside Search Coordinators, Associates also oversee the flow of candidate information to the client.
Requirements:
IM seeks STEM Associate candidates who are drawn to the firm’s belief in the power of exceptional leadership and an unwavering commitment to service excellence. An investment in the success and integrity of the firm as a whole is essential, as is a commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion, and the cultural competence to work effectively across multiple lines of difference.

Communication
Exceptional written and oral communication skills.
Maturity and discretion in maintaining strong relationships with multiple constituencies, often involving issues of confidentiality.

The ability to evaluate the accomplishments, credibility, and organizational fit of prospective candidates using evidence-based assessment.

JOB TITLE

Software Application Engineer I or II

JOB DESCRIPTION SUMMARY

As highly collaborative members of the DevOps Team in Information Technology Services, Software Application Engineers create and maintain software components within the University’s business application systems architecture. Software solutions developed typically involve inter-system integrations, complex processes, new functionality to extend an application’s capabilities, and advanced data manipulations and reporting functions. Software Application Engineers (SAEs) design, code, unit test, debug, document, implement, and maintain these programs and components in an organized software engineering environment based on agile development and deployment practices. The SAE has primary areas of responsibility within the applications architecture and technology stacks employed by the University but will also cross-train and serve as a backup to team SAEs in other application areas.

A secondary, but significant role of the Software Application Engineer is to work within the assigned applications environments to manage complex administration of the application. This includes responsibilities such as managing configuration controls, security configurations, and security assignments for the business application.

Software Application Engineer I or II


As highly collaborative members of the DevOps Team in Information Technology Services, Software Application Engineers create and maintain software components within the University’s business application systems architecture. Software solutions developed typically involve inter-system integrations, complex processes, new functionality to extend an application’s capabilities, and advanced data manipulations and reporting functions. Software Application Engineers (SAEs) design, code, unit test, debug, document, implement, and maintain these programs and components in an organized software engineering environment based on agile development and deployment practices. The SAE has primary areas of responsibility within the applications architecture and technology stacks employed by the University but will also cross-train and serve as a backup to team SAEs in other application areas.

A secondary, but significant role of the Software Application Engineer is to work within the assigned applications environments to manage complex administration of the application. This includes responsibilities such as managing configuration controls, security configurations, and security assignments for the business application.
Software Application Engineers are classified as level I, II, or III depending on skills, experience, and qualifications. Higher-level SAEs perform more technical leadership within the DevOps team and have a higher level of design responsibilities for larger-scale projects.

Florida Poly’s business systems architecture includes Workday ERP, Ellucian Banner SaaS ERP, Salesforce, and Blackbaud core business systems as well as forty or more associated business applications.
