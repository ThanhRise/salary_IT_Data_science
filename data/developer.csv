ASP .NET Developer,$63K - $101K (Glassdoor est.),"Job description

· Resources needed to code the front-end user interface of the Geodetics Database - Office Module. The legacy technology is in the Oracle Forms/WebLogic and will be redeveloped using .NET Core/(ASP.NET). The database will remain in Oracle 19.c. with no substantial redesign anticipated. An ArcGIS Portal integration is planned via the ArcGIS JavaScript API. Office Module front-end user interface will be developed using Azure App Services infrastructure.

· An ESRI Field Maps application (data gathering) integration is also planned. No direct use of ESRI is anticipated, but data from that application needs to be integrated with the new Office Module.

· At a high level, the resources will become the primary .NET Core/(ASP.NET) coders to develop the front-end user interface for the Geodetics Database - Office Module. In addition, the resources will become the primary ArcGIS JavaScript API integrators with the Office Module.

The redevelopment effort will transform the technical architecture and code base, but not introduce new functionality. The architect of the legacy system will participate in the Agile development team and provide Oracle 19.c. and business expertise.

Frontend Engineer,$125K - $155K (Employer est.),"Who we are

The problem: Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.

About Pano: Pano is a venture-backed early-stage climate tech startup that is the leader in wildfire early detection, leveraging the latest advancements in IoT, AI, satellites, and SaaS software to deliver actionable intelligence to customers. Pano leverages mountaintop cameras and satellites to detect the first traces of smoke and put real-time fire images in the hands of asset owners and first responders to speed up containment. Pano is already partnering with major utilities, fire authorities, and government agencies in the USA and Australia.

Software Engineer – Frontend,$105K - $169K (Glassdoor est.),"Padlet is building software for a good education. A good education is one that inspires curiosity, creativity, and community. Our software enables that through visual content creation and collaboration in millions of classrooms worldwide.

Think of an exceptional product, say the Dyson vacuum cleaner or WD40. What makes it exceptional is that not only does it perform its function well, it makes you feel great using it. It almost makes you want to have more problems so you could use the product more.
We want Padlet to be an exceptional product. We are looking for Frontend Engineers to improve our web apps and delight a billion people.
Responsibilities
Building new features. E.g. creating beautiful slideshows in Padlet.
Creating delight. E.g. through animations and micro UI.
Making the web apps faster. E.g. reducing javascript payload.
Improving how we work. E.g. improving our component library or tools we use to translate the web app into 40+ languages.
Qualifications
At some point in your life, someone has told you: “you write good code.”
You know how to copy-paste code from Stack Overflow.
About Padlet
Vision: Every child in the world will grow up with Mickey Mouse and Padlet.
Product: We are making the default way of collecting and sharing thoughts on the Internet. People love the product.
Impact: We have over 50 million active users making Padlet one of the most used apps on the planet. Our goal is to be THE the most used app on the planet.
Money: We are venture backed AND profitable. We are built to last one hundred years.
Badassery: We are 36 people (plus a baby crane that we've adopted but it doesn't really do much). That's over a million active users per employee. Some badass people work here.
Tech stack
Web: VueJS, Tailwind.
Mobile apps: React Native (with Swift and Java where necessary.)
Backend: Ruby (Rails), Typescript, Elixir (Phoenix), and Python.
Storage: Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, Firestore, and Snowflake.
Joys of engineering at Padlet
We have very few meetings. We value keeping you in flow.
A lot of people use Padlet. We have to solve interesting real-time collaboration problems.
Our users are in over 200 countries, using all kinds of devices and connections, and speaking over 40 languages. We have to solve interesting internationalization problems.
We like to craft delightful user experiences. They’re satisfying to build.
We try to solve problems creatively instead of just throwing money at them. We are engineers! We thrive in constraints, not in the absence of them.
We ship often.
We value beautiful code.
Sorrows of engineering at Padlet
We grew pretty fast last year and our processes are still catching up. E.g. we don't have 100% code coverage yet. Our deployment process isn't as painless as it could be. This sometimes leads to spending time on things that aren't the most fun. We’re working on it!
Our project management process could be better. This sometimes leads to re-speccing in the middle of development, getting in the way of programming flow. We’re working on it!
Some people you‘d be working with
Josh Hewitt: insists that wallabies and kangaroos are different animals, artificially inflating the biodiversity of his homeland. Is excellent at surgically improving an existing, complicated system.
Colin Teahan: lives for one-liners. E.g: Colleague: “Wouldn’t it be funny if Iron Man were anemic?” Teahan: “It would be IRONIC.” Single-handedly wrote early versions of our iOS and Android apps.
The office
Our office is in the middle of Presidio, a beautiful national park. We’re 5 minutes from the beach, a walk we take often. The WiFi works outdoors. You can work sitting in a lawn overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge.

All the gadgetry you need, including a new phone every year.
Special time to join

Web Backend Developer,$35.00 - $60.00 Per Hour (Employer est.),"Infinity Design is looking for an experienced software/web developer who is primarily proficient with VB/VB.NET, ASP.NET, SQL and IIS. We are a small, down-to-earth firm located in Central Vermont and ideally would love a candidate who is a self-starter and is able to work independently and remotely. Ultimately we would love a ""local"" individual who cares about our clients and ideals just as much as we do.
Our immediate need is a quick learner to work on a custom .NET 4.6 ecommerce solution with a business layer, database layer and web projects. The codebase is in VB. The SQL databases use a large amount of stored procedures, many of which are relatively complex. The software is integrated with Shipworks to process shipping, and Braintree for web ordering. Payments are partially processed offline by the client while the complete real-time Braintree integration continues being developed.
Direct experience with Visual Studio, SourceSafe, GitHub and other repository systems are fundamental requirements. Source is in .git but there are currently no devops setup. Visual Studio/IIS/SQL are used locally and then manually deployed to development and production servers. Accordingly, a skilled understanding of IIS and SQL database management are also required.
While the majority of the development focus is on the underlying business layer, working knowledge of HTML/ASP.NET, CSS, Javascript and webforms are definite pluses and will potentially be utilized!
In addition to the technical requirements, our ideal candidate would have the ability to understand, debug, modify and update existing code bases; have high-level problem solving skills and be able to learn from and adapt to problems presented; have the ability to think about tasks and devise best-case solutions. Exceptional organization and commenting skills are a big plus.

Responsibilities
Write C# .Net customizations to meet project requirements for specific implementations of our ecommerce, integration and other custom application development projects. This work is based on detailed wire frames, functional design documentation and technical approach specifications (use cases and requirements). Communicate daily with project management team internally via e-mail, on the phone and in person to update on project status (typically stand-up format or similar brief update reviews). Work with technical client team members to resolve any technical issues (if and when needed this is usually via Screenhero, GoToMeeting or similar WebEx style format). Follow internal processes for communicating current project progress, providing time line estimates, and estimating work orders. Work with clients through debugging and quality assurance cycles.
A typical week will include 4-5 stand up style meetings or other brief meeting formats to confirm internal status on projects; typically 1-2 phone meetings with clients to share updates and provide technical support if needed (our PM team runs the meetings 95% of the time); architecting or modifying an Enterprise C# based solution with projects for each customization/layer of the client's project; light work with a MS SQL database, creating LINQ or Entity Framework data layer, setting up back end business logic/workflows, wiring ASP.NET code to the back end workflows (much of the time this is now wiring Angular logic to back end workflows via Restful services - and primarily creating and validating those Restful services); testing completed features; debugging client trouble tickets; suggesting changes on all aspects of the company during a weekly review meeting; and a Friday team breakfast.
As Clarity continues to grow over the next 12-18 months we will be leveraging Client feedback and internal best practices to continue development of a standard code base we leverage for all our Client projects. In addition, Clarity will continue launching several new updates to our ecommerce and integration framework as well as further enhancing and releasing our business intelligence framework. We operate these product development teams in an scrum based agile model for internal development and for many of our client facing customization projects. This mix of internal and client facing projects enables team members to grow their skill set based on new client challenges while having a solid framework to consistently build and improve on throughout.

Jr. Front-End Developer,$65K - $108K (Glassdoor est.),"About You
Does this sound like you?
You have at least 1-2 years of your developer journey completed, and the most important thing to you about a new job is being surrounded by smart people.
You’ve worked on the same project long enough that you’re disappointed with a feature you built months ago (you can build it better now).
You're always looking for ways to improve the user experience with design and functionality.
You think asking questions or saying, “I don’t know” is a strength, not a weakness.
You’re wildly talented and can’t wait to share the knowledge you have or new tech you learned over a weekend.
You know Git, or at least you know how to pull, commit, fork and branch.
Collaboration is of utmost importance
You dabble in WordPress theme-ing or are a WordPress Developer.
You know Magento isn’t a color and aren’t afraid of XML layouts.
Development is a craft you are learning and hope to perform daily with integrity. Good simply isn’t good enough.
How did you know? That’s me!
Fantastic.
Here’s a bit more about the job.
Work with various development teams across the nation - and sometimes overseas
- to develop harder working websites using HTML, Sass and JS.
Work with MVC Frameworks in both PHP and .NET programming languages.
Use and develop for platforms like WordPress, Shopify, Kentico, nopCommerce, Magento and sometimes custom tailored CMSs.
All code you write will be tracked with Git and you’ll be responsible for your part in a feature-branch workflow.
For platforms like Kentico and WordPress, you will support backend teams in developing plugins or extensions to fit project requirements.
You’ll use Figma and Adobe Suite to edit/modify/optimize images and break apart PSD designs into HTML/CSS/JS and integrate with aforementioned frameworks.
Your day-to-day will include working on multiple client projects at a time. Some from scratch and others from existing projects that need maintenance or feature updates.
You will manage your own tasks and queue of work given to you by the project management team or customer support.
You’ll estimate work, brainstorming strategy, and creating proof-of-concepts for new business.
GoldenComm is all for sharing knowledge. From time to time you might give a presentation on tech, code patterns or strategies to your team.

We do what’s right for the client, not just what’s easy. And that’s what makes our jobs gratifying.

Basically, we need someone who’s willing to work really hard and doesn’t get discouraged when a client or project is going off the rails. So if you’ve got a lot of grit and an equal amount of gumption, keep reading...
JOB DESCRIPTION:
The Front End Web Designer will be responsible for creative content management design and ongoing maintenance, building client marketing websites that drive leads and convert leads to customers. This role is design-focused and requires no coding experience, however foundational understanding of CSS and HTML is a plus. We are looking for a creative designer interested in executing front end web projects, directly applying their creativity to websites during the build process. A strong eye for design, organized workflow, and ability to multi-task is essential.
Essential Functions:
Designing & Building Websites: You will be designing & building your own websites as well as building custom websites proofed by our Design team. Using a visual, drag and drop content management system, you will create unique, aesthetically exciting websites that reflect the clients’ brand while adhering to our high quality standards.
Ongoing Maintenance: Our client relationships don’t end when the website launches. Our clients will submit post-launch update requests that you will vet for clarity and scope, make recommendations on, and ultimately execute.
Creative Direction: Conceptualizing page layouts, animations and user interactions are critical to successful website projects. You will provide clients with suggested color palettes, typography pairings, and high-level page layouts prior to full build-out.
Quality Assurance: You ensure that your own work and that of your peers is branded appropriately for each client, accurate, and high-quality. From reviewing appropriate padding, alignment and animation execution to testing mobile device responsiveness, you will always strive for an aesthetic that is fresh and effective.
Marketing Strategy: You will make recommendations on design, conversion opportunities, and user experience to make the most of a client’s marketing package. You will participate in client kick-off calls and speak directly with the end client. You think critically and make judgements in the best interest of the website visitor.
Core Competencies:
Intuitive Communication: You will interface directly with clients at specific touch points and will be responsible for communicating clearly and effectively, both with clients and internal teams. You must be personable, professional, and responsive. You will need to know when to ask the right questions and be prepared to get answers to our front line sales and account management teams quickly and accurately.
Obsessive Attention to Detail: Front End Web Designers must recognize when spacing isn’t quite right or an extra digit exists in a phone number. You will share accountability for the accuracy and quality of our company’s work. Attention to detail is crucial, so please include the title of your favorite movie or book at the beginning of your email or application.
Expert Organization and Project Management: If someone asks you to describe yourself and you wouldn't say ""organized,"" you need not apply. Front End Web Designers must be organized and able to multitask many projects at once, hitting your deliverable deadlines at various stages of the project lifecycle. A honed sense of urgency in order to prioritize your workload is paramount to success at our agency.
Keen Analytical Skills: We measure everything we do by its ROI. You will need a basic understanding of marketing metrics and KPIs, along with the ability to dissect and solve problems through data. Working on and with the web team, you will need to be able to recognize when an approach isn’t working and make suggestions to improve our processes and procedures in order to gain back efficiencies that ultimately benefit our clients’ website projects.
“Big Picture” Thinking and Knowledge of Digital Marketing: Every digital marketing service we offer ties into the next. When a client makes a request to update their website, how will that affect their SEO or PPC campaigns? We need someone who can see the connections and make good choices for both the client and the agency as a whole.
Resourceful and Confident Self-Starter: Once you learn the ropes, we’ll expect you to own your projects to keep them moving forward. You will need to take the initiative to make decisions and recommendations, and to follow up with Account Managers to progress projects and hit our monthly projections. You will solve problems every single day, so we need someone with a solutions-oriented mind.
Takes Pride In Work: We need someone who takes any project, big or small, and puts everything they have into it. Mistakes are okay. Sloppiness is not.
Personality Musts: ‍
Our perfect fit is someone who is a problem solver who understands the difference between “yes, and…” and “yes, but…”. You should be a hungry, scrappy personality with a positive attitude and aims to deliver. Working in the client service industry can mean going the extra mile, and we need someone who is always willing to rise to the occasion for our clients and strives to put forward beautiful work that exceeds client expectations. Someone who is detailed and organized, driven and displays vigor and comes ready to play every day. Confidence, self-discipline, and a congenial, curious mind are things we love and admire.

Our engineering teams are 100% US-based with our first engineering center in Brunswick, ME. We focus on applications in Medical, Industrial, Consumer Devices, Automotive, and Financial industries.
We help our clients accomplish their digital transformation strategies by moving their products and systems to the Cloud, by changing devices into smart, connected IoT ‘things’, and turning big data into business opportunities.
We design and build products and systems using the latest technologies—sometimes starting from a clean sheet of paper, and sometimes by reengineering and migrating legacy software to the Cloud.
Our mission is to out-perform the competition in the US and offshore in every way we can—starting with the people we hire to the technology we use to the collaborative experience you have working with us—at a competitive price.
Why Join Our Team
At VividCloud, we care deeply about keeping our employees happy. Yes, we offer great pay. We strive to be the most competitive in our market and industry when it comes to compensation and benefits.

We offer very competitive compensation.
Our health benefits are effective on your very first day of hire.

We will encourage and pay for your skill certifications.
Based in Brunswick, Maine, VividCloud is looking for Software Engineers at various levels from Junior to Principal. This role is open to candidates only in Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.
The truly unique thing about our company is that we don't hire people for specific roles, but instead we try to find well rounded engineers/developers who want to be in control of their future growth. The reason for this is we have so many projects going on with various clients, that it gives our engineers the opportunity to be able to slot into different teams if they need a switch up and want to learn new skillsets. We never want to put someone in a box. We also offer a lot of paid certifications and training courses, so if you are wanting to add to your skillset, we encourage it and will help in any way that we can.

From this unrivaled vantage into the southern sky, the Giant Magellan Telescope will produce the sharpest and most detailed images ever taken of our universe.
When complete in the late 2020s, the Giant Magellan Telescope will be the largest public-private funded science project in history. The endeavor was founded by an international consortium of leading universities and research institutions representing five countries, and is managed by the GMTO Corporation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Pasadena, California. Our culture is impactful, inclusive, and fearlessly innovative. We solve the most difficult engineering challenges and scientific questions with talented individuals who share a passion for revolutionizing humanity’s knowledge of the universe.

At Wonderist Agency, we guarantee you’ll have problems to solve. You’ll be dragged into projects in the 11th hour. And you’ll be expected to create and contribute to our ever-evolving processes. The work isn’t easy. It’s dental. And there’s plenty to go around.
We need a skilled Front End Web Designer with the flexibility to turn on your heels when priorities change, the thoughtfulness to do what’s in the best interest of the team, and the desire to always produce your best work. We do what’s right for the client, not just what’s easy. And that’s what makes our jobs gratifying. Along with unlimited PTO and a dog-friendly office, these are some of the reasons Wonderist Agency has been voted one of San Diego's Best Places to Work.
We are a fast-growing startup of over 35, and that means we’re agile. We’re able to try new things and experiment. It also means we make time to celebrate the work, each other when we hit our quarterly goals, or every Friday at 5 pm. Our favorite dive bar, Desi’s, is just down the street and right across from Liberty Station, so we’ve got our location going for us.
Basically, we need someone who’s willing to work really hard and doesn’t get discouraged when a client or project is going off the rails. So if you’ve got a lot of grit and an equal amount of gumption, keep reading...
JOB DESCRIPTION:
The Front End Web Designer will be responsible for creative content management design and ongoing maintenance, building client marketing websites that drive leads and convert leads to customers. This role is design-focused and requires no coding experience, however foundational understanding of CSS and HTML is a plus. We are looking for a creative designer interested in executing front end web projects, directly applying their creativity to websites during the build process. A strong eye for design, organized workflow, and ability to multi-task is essential.
Essential Functions:
Designing & Building Websites: You will be designing & building your own websites as well as building custom websites proofed by our Design team. Using a visual, drag and drop content management system, you will create unique, aesthetically exciting websites that reflect the clients’ brand while adhering to our high quality standards.
Ongoing Maintenance: Our client relationships don’t end when the website launches. Our clients will submit post-launch update requests that you will vet for clarity and scope, make recommendations on, and ultimately execute.
Creative Direction: Conceptualizing page layouts, animations and user interactions are critical to successful website projects. You will provide clients with suggested color palettes, typography pairings, and high-level page layouts prior to full build-out.
Quality Assurance: You ensure that your own work and that of your peers is branded appropriately for each client, accurate, and high-quality. From reviewing appropriate padding, alignment and animation execution to testing mobile device responsiveness, you will always strive for an aesthetic that is fresh and effective.
Marketing Strategy: You will make recommendations on design, conversion opportunities, and user experience to make the most of a client’s marketing package. You will participate in client kick-off calls and speak directly with the end client. You think critically and make judgements in the best interest of the website visitor.

Obsessive Attention to Detail: Front End Web Designers must recognize when spacing isn’t quite right or an extra digit exists in a phone number. You will share accountability for the accuracy and quality of our company’s work. Attention to detail is crucial, so please include the title of your favorite movie or book at the beginning of your email or application.
Expert Organization and Project Management: If someone asks you to describe yourself and you wouldn't say ""organized,"" you need not apply. Front End Web Designers must be organized and able to multitask many projects at once, hitting your deliverable deadlines at various stages of the project lifecycle. A honed sense of urgency in order to prioritize your workload is paramount to success at our agency.
Keen Analytical Skills: We measure everything we do by its ROI. You will need a basic understanding of marketing metrics and KPIs, along with the ability to dissect and solve problems through data. Working on and with the web team, you will need to be able to recognize when an approach isn’t working and make suggestions to improve our processes and procedures in order to gain back efficiencies that ultimately benefit our clients’ website projects.
“Big Picture” Thinking and Knowledge of Digital Marketing: Every digital marketing service we offer ties into the next. When a client makes a request to update their website, how will that affect their SEO or PPC campaigns? We need someone who can see the connections and make good choices for both the client and the agency as a whole.
Resourceful and Confident Self-Starter: Once you learn the ropes, we’ll expect you to own your projects to keep them moving forward. You will need to take the initiative to make decisions and recommendations, and to follow up with Account Managers to progress projects and hit our monthly projections. You will solve problems every single day, so we need someone with a solutions-oriented mind.
Takes Pride In Work: We need someone who takes any project, big or small, and puts everything they have into it. Mistakes are okay. Sloppiness is not.
Personality Musts: ‍
Our perfect fit is someone who is a problem solver who understands the difference between “yes, and…” and “yes, but…”. You should be a hungry, scrappy personality with a positive attitude and aims to deliver. Working in the client service industry can mean going the extra mile, and we need someone who is always willing to rise to the occasion for our clients and strives to put forward beautiful work that exceeds client expectations. Someone who is detailed and organized, driven and displays vigor and comes ready to play every day. Confidence, self-discipline, and a congenial, curious mind are things we love and admire.

Frontend Engineer,$125K - $155K (Employer est.),"Who we are

The problem: Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.

About Pano: Pano is a venture-backed early-stage climate tech startup that is the leader in wildfire early detection, leveraging the latest advancements in IoT, AI, satellites, and SaaS software to deliver actionable intelligence to customers. Pano leverages mountaintop cameras and satellites to detect the first traces of smoke and put real-time fire images in the hands of asset owners and first responders to speed up containment. Pano is already partnering with major utilities, fire authorities, and government agencies in the USA and Australia.
