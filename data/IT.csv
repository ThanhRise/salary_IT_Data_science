We are open-minded and candid with each other so we can find out what is true and consider alternative viewpoints. We believe in creating and using well-documented systems.
Be part of a growing team, loved by our clients, with many opportunities for future growth, training, and development.

Mac Help Desk Tech (Entry Level),$15.00 - $20.00 Per Hour (Employer est.),"Do you love the Mac, iPhone, and iPad?
Do you love helping people with their technology?
Do you want to be more than a Geek, more than a Genius?
Maybe you're a Windows-first tech who wants to maintain your skills in Microsoft 365, but also dip your toe in Google Workspace, and get really good at Apple device management.
And maybe you're sick of corporate drama, and have no desire to ""return to the office.""
Our client base is growing fast and our business is uniquely positioned to be the leader in Mac support in the greater Kansas City area and nationwide. You'll find our environment to be fun, flexible, free of micro-management, but at the same time engaging with new learning opportunities always available.
You will be providing helpdesk-style tech support to end users remotely with screen sharing or SSH. Very rarely - if you are local to a client - we may ask you to go to a client's office. (We have no physical office space. We've been WFH since 2010 and will never go back.)
You'll also be responding to and correcting automated alerts like backup and drive failures. Later on, you'll be involved in upgrades, onboarding, and other processes. You'll also get really good at cyber hygiene to keep our clients safe.
It's helpful if you have all this stuff:
some experience in supporting desktop applications (Office, Creative Cloud, etc.)
some experience managing Windows devices in Microsoft 365 (Intune, Entra)
experience troubleshooting computer hardware/software and basic networks
excellent problem solving abilities
But we can train you on all that as long as you have some technical aptitude and are a quick study. So, certifications are not required, but might be preferred. If you're not certified, we will train and assist you with acquiring them.
What we can't train you on is what we are really looking for:
a self-starter and independent worker
organized and attentive to detail
customer service oriented
personable and professional
committed to your co-workers and the success of the team
ensuring that technology just works for our clients
Compensation is negotiable, depending on your skill level and availability. Part-time and full-time positions available. Daytime availability somewhere between 7am to 7pm Central time M-F is mandatory. Health benefits are also available as part of a compensation package.
Maybe the most important benefit is that we are an established, 24-year-old small business, founder-led, with no corporate politics. We value work-life harmony (not just balance) and we always put family first. We've had multiple employees tell us this was one of, if not their favorite job in their careers so far.
You ready to ditch the drama and try something different? We can't wait to meet you.

You: An up-and-coming technology guru with beginner to intermediate-level support experience with a passion for helping your colleagues resolve their technical barriers to become the most effective advocates for PLF’s mission. In addition, you are dedicated to mastering all our technology software to elevate your colleagues’ ability to use them efficiently and effectively. More importantly, you are customer-focused and thrive on getting the best possible outcome for your colleagues.
Them: Bureaucrats, city councils, mayors, governors, and federal agencies stripping Americans of their rights every day. There’s a lot of government overreach out there, and it’s backed by seemingly endless resources. But fortunately, like all lumbering giants, abusive government is most vulnerable when countered by individuals who act strategically and nimbly, take calculated risks, have each other’s backs, and are confident in, and passionate for, the cause—the very sort of swashbucklers we employ in spades here at PLF.
Us: We fight back. Pacific Legal Foundation is the nation’s first and most successful public interest law firm dedicated to vindicating individual liberty. PLF has an unmatched record in the United States Supreme Court, with 17 victories out of 19 cases litigated at the Court. We also have more than a hundred active cases across the nation.
We are a next-generation public interest law firm. What does “next-generation” mean for a legal nonprofit? It means we aren’t interested in doing the same thing as everyone else. We aspire to be the best player in a constantly changing game.
Getting down to brass tacks, your specific job duties likely will include:
Being the first set of eyes on every ticket that arrives at our helpdesk system.
Providing first-level (Tier 1) technical support to internal staff members.
Ability to know when to escalate issues to (Tier 2) support.
Setting up devices and installing applications for new employees.
Helping to manage inventory of PLF’s equipment and licenses.
Assisting in new-hire onboarding with technology walk-throughs for new staff.
This role is ideal for someone with:
An incredibly strong customer service mentality.
A sharp attention to detail.
An understanding of and support for the organization’s mission and vision for individual liberty.
1+ years of helpdesk or technology support experience preferred.
Prior support experience with both Windows and MacOS systems is highly preferred.
Some familiarity with iOS and Android mobile platforms
Experience with Office 365 (Outlook, Word, Excel, Teams, and OneDrive). RingCentral, Zoom, Adobe Creative Suite,
Salesforce, and Asana are a plus—but not required.
Awareness and understanding of current IT Security threats (i.e. Viruses, malware, ransomware, spam, spoofing, fishing, etc.)
Willingness to earn IT certifications – but they are not required.
This role reports directly to the IT Training Manager and will work closely with the entire IT Team. While this is a fully remote position, a major plus for candidates who live near our Arlington, VA, or Sacramento, CA areas who can provide on-site support when needed to our offices. You can expect to travel approximately 15% of the year to our Sacramento, CA, and Arlington, VA offices in addition to our semi-annual company retreats.
GENERAL INFORMATION
Pacific Legal Foundation identifies and litigates important legal issues to set landmark precedents that will benefit Americans nationwide. Using strategic and principled litigation, communications, and research, we battle for freedom in the nation’s courts and the court of public opinion.
As a national nonprofit organization, PLF has brick-and-mortar offices in Sacramento, CA; Arlington, VA; and Palm Beach Gardens, FL, although approximately half of the staff work from home offices across the country.
TO APPLY:
If you think you might be a good fit, please submit the following application materials.
Your resume, including your experience in the liberty movement and relevant professional experience
A cover letter explaining why PLF is the place for you, why you want to fight for liberty, and what distinguishes you from typical applicants
This is a full-time, permanent position. PLF is committed to recruiting and retaining the highest-quality talent available nationwide, and we offer a total compensation package that includes a competitive salary, medical and dental insurance, and employer-paid retirement savings. We take work-life balance seriously through our generous paid leave and flextime policies. We have a flexible, collaborative, positive, and collegial work environment.

For this position, the minimum is $47,500 and the midpoint is $57,000.

A complete application includes a cover letter and resume.

This position requires a background check once a job offer is extended to the final candidate. PPSAT does not discriminate in employment and understands the many barriers candidates may face when applying to jobs. One of those barriers is the criminal justice system and its effects on background checks. We understand that these barriers more often negatively impact BIPOC. A conviction is not an absolute bar to employment. Factors such as the age of the offense, evidence of rehabilitation, the seriousness of violation, and job relatedness are considered in all employment decisions.

Help Desk Technician I,$20.00 - $24.00 Per Hour (Employer est.),"Hey! My name is Chris Shirran, and I am the COO and co-founder of Unite IT Services. We're expanding and invite you to apply for a job, company, and workload that doesn't suck!

Why work for us?

You want to be introduced to a wide variety of information systems across a variety of environments, with ample opportunity to expand laterally and vertically into new skill sets, all in a practical, safe, and cooperative work environment. We believe you should be paid twice in your profession: In money and new experiences.
You're not interested in being a cog in some large corporate machine. You're not the ""Windows Deployment"" or ""User and Password"" technician, sitting in front of a desk for 8 hours as a one-trick pony, bored to tears. You're a valued, trusted, and important part of our operations, and should aspire to more. You're here to work with the machines, not BE them.
You want to work in a largely low stress work environment. We achieve this by saying ""No"". A lot. Clients with little basic IT know-how, minimal budget for reliable IT solutions, and even less patience? We don't take them. We deploy best in class software and hardware solutions, and only take clients on that appreciate the time and energy put into keeping things running smooth. This keeps meltdown's non-existent, and major IT incidents manageable.
You don't want to dread going into the office? Then stay home! We utilize a flexible hybrid solution to allow employees to reap the benefits of working from home.
You want supervisors that are worth it. They say people don't quit jobs, they quit managers, and we agree. That's why we quit ours and started UNITE! Supervisors are here to step in, lend a hand, and most importantly lead by example. You won't be asked to do anything the owners of the company wouldn't do themselves. We have an open door policy and our employees use it.

Temporary Disability (TDB) and Long-term Disability Insurance

Educational Assistance
SCSO’s Educational Assistance Program is designed to financially assist full-time employees in good standing who have completed their initial new hire probationary period and are pursuing a college-level degree (i.e. Associates, Bachelors, Graduate Certificate, Masters, Professional Graduate and Doctoral).

Nationwide Deferred Compensation Plans
Employees can choose to participate in a Nationwide 457(b) deferred compensation plan which allows employees to put aside pre-tax money from each paycheck toward retirement.

An after-tax Nationwide Roth contribution plan is also available

Retirement Plans
SCSO participates in the Florida Retirement System (FRS), which offers two plans for all full-time and part-time employees: The Pension Plan and the Investment Plan. Under each plan, employees contribute a small percentage of their gross salary toward the plan and the SCSO contributes a percentage, as well. These percentages are subject to change annually based on the FRS guidelines and are not determined by the SCSO. For more details, please visit http://www.myfrs.com.

The Pension Plan is a traditional retirement pension plan. Employees are vested after reaching a certain number of years of service at any age (currently eight years of service) or after reaching a pre-designated age with a minimum number of years of service. The benefit an employee receives at retirement is calculated using a formula based on the employee’s age, FRS membership class, years of FRS service, and an average of the highest years of salary. The State Board of Administration invests all Pension Plan assets. At retirement, distributions are made in monthly installments and are guaranteed for the employee’s lifetime.

The Investment Plan is a 401(k)-type retirement investment plan with the employee fully-vested after one year of service. The employee utilizes the FRS Plan’s list of funds to determine their investments of contributions. The benefits an employee receives are based on the account balance at retirement, which depends on the amount of funds the employee and employer have contributed, the investment earnings of the funds selected, and any fees or expenses charged by those funds. The distribution can be paid in a lump sum, a roll-over to another qualified plan, a customized payment schedule, lifetime guaranteed payments, or any combination of these.

Employee Assistance Program (EAP); Live and Work Well
SCSO has a Live and Work Well program available to its employees, which includes seven (7) no-cost visits per life event with our agency.

We believe you should be paid twice in your profession: In money and new experiences.
You're not interested in being a cog in some large corporate machine. You're not the ""Windows Deployment"" or ""User and Password"" technician, sitting in front of a desk for 8 hours as a one-trick pony, bored to tears. You're a valued, trusted, and important part of our operations, and should aspire to more. You're here to work with the machines, not BE them.
You want to work in a largely low stress work environment. We achieve this by saying ""No"". A lot. Clients with little basic IT know-how, minimal budget for reliable IT solutions, and even less patience? We don't take them. We deploy best in class software and hardware solutions, and only take clients on that appreciate the time and energy put into keeping things running smooth. This keeps meltdown's non-existent, and major IT incidents manageable.
You don't want to dread going into the office? Then stay home! We utilize a flexible hybrid solution to allow employees to reap the benefits of working from home.
You want supervisors that are worth it. They say people don't quit jobs, they quit managers, and we agree. That's why we quit ours and started UNITE! Supervisors are here to step in, lend a hand, and most importantly lead by example. You won't be asked to do anything the owners of the company wouldn't do themselves. We have an open door policy and our employees use it.

Nationwide Deferred Compensation Plans
Employees can choose to participate in a Nationwide 457(b) deferred compensation plan which allows employees to put aside pre-tax money from each paycheck toward retirement. Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning employees do not pay income taxes on the contributions or earnings until they retire and/or begin to take payments from the account. An after-tax Nationwide Roth contribution plan is also available

Retirement Plans
SCSO participates in the Florida Retirement System (FRS), which offers two plans for all full-time and part-time employees: The Pension Plan and the Investment Plan. Under each plan, employees contribute a small percentage of their gross salary toward the plan and the SCSO contributes a percentage, as well. These percentages are subject to change annually based on the FRS guidelines and are not determined by the SCSO. For more details, please visit http://www.myfrs.com.

The Pension Plan is a traditional retirement pension plan. Employees are vested after reaching a certain number of years of service at any age (currently eight years of service) or after reaching a pre-designated age with a minimum number of years of service. The benefit an employee receives at retirement is calculated using a formula based on the employee’s age, FRS membership class, years of FRS service, and an average of the highest years of salary. The State Board of Administration invests all Pension Plan assets. At retirement, distributions are made in monthly installments and are guaranteed for the employee’s lifetime.

The Investment Plan is a 401(k)-type retirement investment plan with the employee fully-vested after one year of service. The employee utilizes the FRS Plan’s list of funds to determine their investments of contributions. The benefits an employee receives are based on the account balance at retirement, which depends on the amount of funds the employee and employer have contributed, the investment earnings of the funds selected, and any fees or expenses charged by those funds. The distribution can be paid in a lump sum, a roll-over to another qualified plan, a customized payment schedule, lifetime guaranteed payments, or any combination of these.

Employee Assistance Program (EAP); Live and Work Well
SCSO has a Live and Work Well program available to its employees, which includes seven (7) no-cost visits per life event with our agency. This benefit covers both full-time and part-time agency employees along with their immediate family members (identified as their beneficiaries or dependents).
