Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
About The Role:
Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means millions of people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. The Developer Productivity team is responsible for architecting, implementing, and scaling our tools and frameworks that Notion developers use to build these products for our users. We are looking for engineers who are passionate about solving engineering productivity challenges and have deep empathy for other developers.
What You'll Achieve:
Take ownership of the overall development environment and toolchain, and drive novel projects across the company to deliver impact.
Minimize time spent between code commit and production deploy, via better tooling, testing, framework, and automation, without sacrificing quality or reliability.
Provide top-notch observability tools for Notion engineers to scale Notion reliably.
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
Developer productivity expert: You bring multiple years of expertise in developer productivity, developer experience or DevOps engineering. You have deep understanding of modern development practices and tools, and experience designing, building, and evaluating those tools.
Developer experience mindset: You think critically about how the tools you build will be used by the rest of the engineering team. Your work emphasizes simplicity, supportability, and ease-of-use, and you communicate clearly with other teams to get both structured and unstructured feedback on where we can improve. You have experience supporting developer experience for engineers working on a web client, not just server.
Startup mentality: You are comfortable navigating the fast moving, unstructured nature of a fast-growing startup. You are self-motivated to add value and bias towards action. You understand the importance of setting the engineering quality bar for the long term success of our business without shying away from difficult prioritization decisions.
Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You don't just go after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
Nice to Haves:
You have a deep understanding of TypeScript and how to keep it running smoothly in a large codebase.
You’ve untangled complex codebases with interwoven dependencies to improve developer productivity and tooling speed without compromising reliability.
You have experience in scaling developer experience a hyper-growth startup
You can independently lead a small team and multi-month project end to end to accomplish team goals.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Data Infrastructure Engineer,-1,"Headway’s mission is a big one - to build a new mental health care system everyone can access. We’ve built technology that helps people find great therapists with the first software-enabled national network of providers accepting insurance.
1 in 4 people in the US have a treatable mental health condition, but the majority of providers don’t accept insurance, making therapy too expensive for most people. Headway is building a new mental healthcare system that everyone can access by making it easy for therapists to take insurance and scale their practice.
Headway was founded in 2019 – since then, we’ve grown into a diverse, national network of over 25,000 mental healthcare providers across all 50 states who run their practice on our software. We’re a Series C company with over $225m in funding from a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), Accel, GV (formerly Google Ventures), Spark Capital, Thrive Capital, and Health Care Service Corporation.
We want your time here to be the most meaningful experience of your career. Join us, and help change mental healthcare for the better.
About Infrastructure at Headway
Building a new mental healthcare system at Headway is only possible because of the scale and leverage that software can provide. The infrastructure engineering team at Headway is a small but mighty team building our AWS infrastructure, automated deploy processes, and developer experience that helps us deliver a best-in-class experience for our patients and therapists. As we scale, we're looking for an experienced Data Infrastructure Engineer to help us design and build the infrastructure to support the growth of our data engineering, data analyst and machine learning teams. In this new role, you'd report to our Head of Infrastructure and work closely with our Infrastructure, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning teams to support infrastructure needs as we grow in traffic, data, and scale. Please note that this is not a data engineering role.
Principles that guide us:
Focus on the mission: We view software as a means of effecting change in the world, not as an end unto itself. We write software to empower our patients and therapist to better solve the problems they’re facing.
Ship small, learn fast: We are building new and novel products and believe that we learn what our users need by quickly shipping and iteration.
Everything is a product: Whether it's our patient search experience or a developer productivity improvement, we treat everything we build at Headway as a product with end-users in mind.
Optimize for trust: We believe that engineers should be continually learning. To learn effectively and to be productive, engineers must feel safe asking questions and discussing mistakes.
Who you are
We’re looking for data-focused infrastructure engineers who have the ability to deal with ambiguity and learn new technologies and systems in a fast-paced, high-growth environment. Below are some additional experiences we think help engineers succeed at Headway.
Experience we’re seeking:
3+ years experience as an Infrastructure Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), DevOps, or Software Engineer with a focus on building data infrastructure for high growth data functions (DS/DE/Analytics). Extensive experience with databases and data processing technologies, such as Kafka, Postgres, Spark, Presto, Hive etc.
Cloud infrastructure experience (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
Working knowledge of one or more high-level programming languages (Python, Java, Scala, etc.)
Working knowledge of infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CDK, etc.)
Can communicate well, both verbally and via documentation
Have a track record of working well across teams and functions
Bonus points if you
Experience with monitoring and APM tools (Datadog, New Relic, etc.)
Experience building robust data pipelines, ideally in Spark
Experience working with and maintaining Airflow infrastructure
Understanding of ETL/ELT best practices and technologies
Experience with data security and compliance, particularly in a regulated environment
Experience with Docker
You'll love this role if you want to:
Change the trajectory of a startup striving to redefine access to mental health in America
Work on a highly collaborative, cross-functional engineering team in order to build the best products for therapists, patients, physician and payer partners, and/or your teammates at Headway
Build and improve tooling to make engineering more streamlined and efficient
Help establish and engrain best practices throughout our codebases
Work in a fast-paced, iterative development process
- we release changes to our products multiple times per day!
Contribute to our engineering culture, processes, and documentation with the same thought and care that we do our software (one of our engineering cultural principles is “Everything is a Product”)
Our interview process
After you apply to Headway, here are some details of what to expect during the interview process.
Initial screen: You’ll connect with someone in recruiting so you can learn more about the team, Headway’s mission and exciting growth, and we can get a better idea of your background.
First round: You'll meet with an engineer on the team to complete a technical exercise and learn more about the engineering team.
Final rounds: You’ll meet several more team members for technical and non-technical interviews and leave with a fuller picture of what it’s like to work at Headway.

Chainlink Labs is the primary contributing developer of Chainlink, the decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink is the industry-standard platform for providing access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain. Chainlink Labs helps power verifiable applications for banking, DeFi, global trade, and gaming by collaborating with some of the world’s largest financial institutions, notably Swift, DTCC, and ANZ. Chainlink Labs also works with top Web3 teams, including Aave, Compound, GMX, Maker, and Synthetix. Chainlink Labs was ranked in Newsweek’s 100 Most Loved Workplaces 2023 in both the United States and United Kingdom.

The Engineering Team

About the Role
The Engineering Operations team supports product teams by providing specialized expertise required to keep products in a safe and reliable functioning condition while maximizing delivery velocity. Engineering Operations functions as a security, release, and operational layer ensuring optimal balance between feature delivery velocity and product stability. We focus on minimizing operational risk, improving tempo, and automating manual processes that prevent software delivery from being repeatable and stable.

DevOps Engineer combines software and systems engineering to build and run large-scale, massively distributed, fault-tolerant systems. Much of our software development focuses on building infrastructure and eliminating work through automation. We are distributed across time zones and continents, and we embrace remote work.

In the EngOps team, we follow the infrastructure-as-code approach and practice GitOps. Our on-call rotation uses the follow-the-sun pattern. We all have different backgrounds and are determined to help you succeed no matter where you are or who you are. If you think you would do a great job at Chainlink, we are looking forward to speaking with you, even if you don't match 100% of the job requirements: those describe people we've usually had a great time working with, but they're not a tick-box exercise.

Why you might like this job:
You’ve been always looking for that job that gives you the freedom to build crazy tools from scratch. You’ve always wondered if there’s a place where profits and titles aren’t everyone’s motivation. Where people just want you to make great software tools. You like the idea of working for a locally-owned and operated company that competes in an extremely competitive space nationwide. You like that your work matters today and will affect millions of our business customers and employees.
You love to help people, but you want to take part in the planning without being required to deal with stakeholders and project managers all day. You want to make cool stuff and help other devs out and the company. You want your cool stuff to be really good. But most importantly, if you made a dish of noodles and butter for someone and asked them what they thought of it, if they said it was okay or good and didn’t give you feedback, you’d feel a little left out… you’d want a little more… because okay or good isn’t fulfilling to you.
But at the same time… it’s just a job. Yourself/Family/Friends/Personal Time is number 1. Work is number 2 or 3. Our goal is to use the incredible business we are excited to be a part of to support all of our personal time. We all want to live a full personal life. We’ll have more fun working together during the day if we know there’s a clear cutoff. This way, we can create a work environment where we can not only go home at the end of the day, but mentally shut off work and mentally go home also. We focus on creating a welcoming, supportive job environment that pays well and doesn’t stress you out, so when you call it a day, you go have fun personally.

BigML, is seeking an energetic DevOps engineer to help us make Machine Learning beautifully simple for everyone. Our intuitive API and Web interfaces are built on top of a specialized and distributed Machine Learning backend that we need to run at scale for a fast-growing number of customers in more than 120 countries. We embrace distributed teams and like to work remotely so location is irrelevant for any position at BigML, but we'll do our best to motivate you to temporarily, or permanently, move to Corvallis (Oregon, US) or Valencia (Spain) to work closer to other team members.
Responsibilities:
Our DevOps team is facing the challenge of keeping our product transparently deployable in any platform, from a developer's laptop, to our customer's on-premise clusters and up to our multi-tenant, high-availability cloud service. We are also aiming at being cloud agnostic and providing the infrastructre to make our service deployable and elastic on AWS, GCS and other cloud providers.
That means that, as a key member of our DevOps team, you will have to:
Often cross the line between programmers and old-style sysadmins, and use languages like Python to orchestrate a robust, auto-scalable and nimble fusion of distributed services.
Play a decisive role in choosing the technologies (such as containers or messaging systems) more suitable to meet those objectives, and work closely with our engineering team to make sure our system architecture is up to the challenge.
Answer questions like ""is Kubernetes the right tool, or should we rely on a Docker Fusion instead?,"" ""what is the safest, more efficient way of replicating our RabbitMQ queues?,"" ""is Mesos a good alternative on a fixed cluster?,"" or ""how do I unit test my cross-cloud autoscaler?"" will be on your table.
Desired Skills and Experience
Requirements:
BSc or MSc in Computer Science.
Proficiency with Python.
Deep knowledge of Git.
Extensive experience working with large data stores.
Experience working with cloud-based platforms (EC2, Azure, etc.).
Demonstrable experience with DevOps tools (e.g. Puppet, Cheff, Ansible or Vagrant).
Demonstrable experience with continuous deployment processes.
Experience with MongoDB scalable systems.
Be able to work independently; personal initiative to anticipate and resolve problems.
Pluses, but not required (you'll learn a lot about them working at BigML anyways):
Experience developing Machine Learning-driven Applications
Experience working on ultra-agile distributed teams.
Start-up experience is ideal.

Why you might like this job:
You’ve been always looking for that job that gives you the freedom to build crazy tools from scratch. You’ve always wondered if there’s a place where profits and titles aren’t everyone’s motivation. Where people just want you to make great software tools. You like the idea of working for a locally-owned and operated company that competes in an extremely competitive space nationwide. You like that your work matters today and will affect millions of our business customers and employees.
You love to help people, but you want to take part in the planning without being required to deal with stakeholders and project managers all day. You want to make cool stuff and help other devs out and the company. You want your cool stuff to be really good. But most importantly, if you made a dish of noodles and butter for someone and asked them what they thought of it, if they said it was okay or good and didn’t give you feedback, you’d feel a little left out… you’d want a little more… because okay or good isn’t fulfilling to you.
But at the same time… it’s just a job. Yourself/Family/Friends/Personal Time is number 1. Work is number 2 or 3. Our goal is to use the incredible business we are excited to be a part of to support all of our personal time. We all want to live a full personal life. We’ll have more fun working together during the day if we know there’s a clear cutoff. This way, we can create a work environment where we can not only go home at the end of the day, but mentally shut off work and mentally go home also. We focus on creating a welcoming, supportive job environment that pays well and doesn’t stress you out, so when you call it a day, you go have fun personally.

Position Description


Assistant Professor Daniel Fremont in the Computer Science and Engineering Department invites applications for a junior specialist. Professor Fremont's research group develops algorithms and tools to improve the reliability of software, hardware, and cyber-physical systems like self-driving cars.

We are seeking a software developer to work on infrastructure/DevOps supporting open-source development of the Scenic probabilistic programming language. Scenic is a domain-specific language based on Python used to model the environments of autonomous cyber-physical systems and generate testing or training data to help ensure their safety. We are beginning a project to transition Scenic from an academic tool with a modest user base to a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem. Towards this end, the developer will create infrastructure to support open-source development of Scenic and its broader adoption. In particular, the developer will be responsible for the following activities:
Build a website and database for managing proposals to improve the Scenic language (similar to Python's PEP system).
Develop automation for issue triage and PR review on Scenic's GitHub repository.
Extend our existing CI infrastructure (e.g. with the ability to run external simulators).
Set up an online forum for users and developers of Scenic.
Develop an index for Scenic scenarios and libraries building on the Python Package Index.
Write usage guides, tutorials, and other materials for Scenic's documentation.

Applicants with the following qualifications are strongly encouraged to apply.
Advanced knowledge of Python.
Experience with the Python project's development, packaging, and distribution infrastructure (PyPI, the PEP Index, etc.).
