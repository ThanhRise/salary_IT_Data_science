Logistics
Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time.

Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

US visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Compensation and Benefits*
Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.

Equity - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.

Benefits - Benefits we offer include:
Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.
Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.
401(k) plan with 4% matching.
21 weeks of paid parental leave.
Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!
Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.
Fertility benefits via Carrot.
Daily lunches and snacks in our office.
Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.

This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position, in San Francisco, CA, as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We're trying to build a core of knowledge and intuition about the most robustly effective innovations in AI, and so thoroughly-documented null results are almost as valuable as positive discoveries. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Strong written and verbal communication skills are a must.
BA/BS degree. MBA or Master's degree is a plus.
5+ years of professional experience, ideally in consulting, corporate strategy, or a startup with experience in talent management, strategic workplace planning, people analytics, and/or organizational design.

Pragmatic Problem-solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.

Machine Learning Engineer,$130K (Employer est.),"Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).

As an early member of our ML engineering team, you will help
- push the limits of cutting-edge computing and machine learning
- build the team and drive the direction of the company.
- shape our product and culture.
- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.

The following is a big plus
- fluency in Python, Rust and PyTorch
- experience with training and deploying models in multi-GPU environments
- recognized open-source contributions
- participation in competitive programming events (CTFs, Putnam, IOI, IMO, IPHO, Topcoder, Kaggle, etc.)

Data scientist,$130K (Employer est.),"Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).

As an early member of our data science team, you will help
- push the limits of what can be done with data.
- build the team and drive the direction of the company.
- shape our product and culture.
- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.

The following are required
- the tools: Python, Pandas / Polars, Matplotlib, sklearn, etc.
SQL and fundamental database operations.
- recognized open-source contributions and/or top performance in data competitions (Kaggle, Numerai, etc.).
fluency in statistics and probability.

"Research Engineer, Machine Learning",$120K - $180K (Employer est.),"About Basis
Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.

Quantitative Researcher – Graduate,$200K - $225K (Employer est.),"We’re looking for accomplished researchers who are interested in growing their career in the field of quantitative finance. While the problems we solve at SIG are often different from academia, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding.

The general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
As a Quantitative Researcher, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production.
Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance.
As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.
We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What we're looking for
Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills
Solid communication skills, both in the ability to understand others and to make yourself clearly understood
Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably
Experience working on in-depth research projects
Finance experience is not a requirement

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Systematic Trader position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $200,000 - $225,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. SIG considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

SIG does not accept unsolicited resumes from recruiters or search firms. Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will become the property of SIG and no fee will be paid.

Staff Applied Scientist - Forecasting,-1,"Afresh is on a mission to eliminate food waste and make fresh food accessible to all. Our first A.I.-powered solution optimizes ordering, forecasting, and store operations for fresh food departments in brick-and-mortar grocers. With our Fresh Operating System, regional and national grocery retailers have placed $1.6 billion in produce orders across the US and we've helped our partners prevent 34 million pounds of food from going to waste. Working at Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by leveraging uncommonly impactful software – we hope you'll join us!
About the Role
The Prediction, Optimization, and Planning (POP) team builds Afresh's core replenishment technology. Our AI models are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies. Our team has presented work at multiple industry leading conferences, and we encourage team members to write and present their work publicly.
As an Applied Scientist at Afresh focused on forecasting, you will take your existing knowledge of machine learning and apply it to the challenge of demand forecasting. You will thrive in this role if you love the craft of neural networks in research and production environments: hyperparameter optimization, model tuning, feature selection, thorough error analysis, architecture selection, and deep understanding of the data you are modeling. We are looking for someone who is equally adept at gaining insights from 8 hours of data analysis or 8 hours of reading papers.
Your will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core forecasting system. This will include modeling seasonal demand, rare events, promotion cannibalization, and aggregating correlated demand across multi-echelon systems. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.
You will work on improving the accuracy and calibration of the demand forecasting models that power our warehouse-level and store-level ordering products. You will also lead research development for new product and business challenges.
In your first 3 months, you will acquire a comprehensive understanding of our current forecasting system and modern neural network approaches to time-series forecasting. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and forecasting tools, and you'll test an experimental improvement to our demand forecasting system.
By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to our forecasting system.
By the end of your first year, you will have led the implementation of fundamental changes to our core forecasting system and led research into forecasting extensions (multi-echelon forecasting, rare event modeling).
We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof.
Skills and Experience
5+ years of industrial or academic experience building mission-critical machine learning systems.
Excellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English.
5+ years of experience in neural network libraries (Pytorch/Tensorflow/JAX). Proficiency in Pytorch preferred, or willingness to transition from Tensorflow/JAX.
Fluent in programmatic data analysis using SQL and Pandas.
Excellent data visualization skills.

Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

US visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Compensation and Benefits*
Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.

The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We're trying to build a core of knowledge and intuition about the most robustly effective innovations in AI, and so thoroughly-documented null results are almost as valuable as positive discoveries. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

"Senior Data Scientist, Risk",$112K - $156K (Glassdoor est.),"Company Description
Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Data Engineer,-1,"Position Description
The Center for Computational Biomedicine (CCB) is a new center within the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School. Our mission is to provide cutting-edge computational capabilities, data analysis, and data integration technologies to support medical and biological research within the Medical School. Based at the Harvard Medical School Longwood Campus, we are part of a vibrant community of scientists, physicians, and engineers whose goal is to advance the boundaries of knowledge and improve patient care. The working environment combines the best features of a startup (fast pace, flexibility, flat hierarchies) with those of one of the leading medical schools (excellent benefits, outstanding opportunities for learning, great resources, name recognition).

CCB is looking for an individual to join the Data and Analytic Platforms Group, a group of engineers and scientists developing data warehousing and analytic solutions in support of epidemiology, healthcare economics, machine learning, and basic science research.

The Group works to reduce the burden on faculty by developing centrally managed and shareable data solutions to be used across research silos. We curate very large public and private healthcare utilization (insurance claims, electronic health record), multi-omics, environmental exposure, and social determinants data sets, provision access to those curated data sets, and develop analytic frameworks to accelerate reproducible academic research on top of them. Collectively these data sets contain information relating to hundreds of millions of patients.

This position reports to the Director of the CCB Data and Analytic Platforms Group. Primary responsibilities will include designing and implementing relational database architecture (schema, indexing, stored procedures, ETL processes, etc.) to warehouse multi-terabyte data sets in Microsoft SQL Server. This will include periodically evaluating various query performance metrics to ensure real-time availability to the research community and recommending modifications to the underlying database platform to resolve any identified issues. The bulk of this design work will be left up with the candidate, while a small portion will involve refactoring (or strategically deciding to abandon) existing ETL / indexing strategies. The data sets will be staged into a combination of proprietary schemas as well as the open-source i2b2 data model.

Additional opportunities will be available for the candidate to interact with individual scientific research teams to help improve their workflows.
Basic Qualifications
Minimum of seven years’ post-secondary education or relevant work experience
Additional Qualifications and Skills
Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or related degree preferred. At least 5 years experience as a software systems architect, including experience developing solutions with both relational database systems and at least one of the following languages: Java, Python, R.

Excellent communication skills, both written and oral
Experience with Microsoft SQL Server or cloud-based data warehousing technologies
Experience designing and maintaining multi-terabyte analytic relational databases, including index and query optimization
Experience orchestrating and optimizing Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes for multi- terabyte data warehouses
Comfort doing basic system administration in a Linux environment Comfort doing basic system administration in a Windows environment Experience with relational database index optimization
Experience with containerized (Docker or Singularity) workflows/paradigms
Experience with non-relational database systems (graph, key/value, document, array data stores) Experience with the R statistical computing platform
Experience with Java Experience with Python
Experience with high-performance computing
Comfort independently exploring distributed computing and database technologies and generating executive reports
Experience with public cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
