"Backend Software Engineer, Cell Software",$145K - $213K (Glassdoor est.),"What to Expect
Tesla is re-thinking how batteries are made from the ground up. We’re designing new factories, new equipment, new processes, and new software to rapidly scale battery manufacturing, globally. The primary bottleneck to Tesla’s future expansion (and the transition to sustainable transport and energy storage) is our ability to produce and procure batteries – that’s why we’re innovating in-house, with our collection of world-class engineers, to redefine the industry. Software, data, and automation all play a huge part in this strategy. We’ve built software from scratch with a nimble and high performing team to meet the specific needs of Tesla’s rapid battery manufacturing scale up. This software tracks every component of the cell manufacturing process and acts as the brain of the entire cell factory. It’s key to ensuring batteries are made safely and for understanding how to improve processes. This platform is the conduit for data coming from the line, and it is part of the goal to have more data about manufacturing, end to end, than any other company. The Cell Software team is responsible for building software solutions that allow the company to redefine manufacturing and production. We focus on implementing effective software advances, distributed fault-tolerant computing, and modern user- experience to manufacturing systems throughout Tesla. Our stack is built on top of Kubernetes, Kafka, React, Go, PostgreSQL and other related platforms. We are not stuck in legacy systems. We’re looking a developer to build new features for our Manufacturing Execution application, which interacts with PLCs and other equipment on the line (thousands of devices) to collect, analyze and direct manufacturing processes. You will be given direction about new requirements and features that need to be delivered, and then obtain the necessary information to build out solutions that directly solve Tesla business challenges.

What You’ll Do
Solve world-first computing problems at scale that allow us to do more with our huge set of data
Write backend code that unlocks new features for engineers and associates across the manufacturing domain, and work with colleagues to integrate this code with our frontend
Write code that is reliable, well tested and which directly impacts Tesla’s bottom line
Interface with controls engineers, operators and other engineers to build the most effective automation systems and solutions. This includes getting immersed in defining and implementing automation system processes flows
Build tools, test-automation and documentation
Respond to and handle manufacturing process change requests promptly
What You’ll Bring
1 + years of experience building backend systems
Exposure to systems that handle large data volumes and throughput
Understanding of algorithms, data structures, concurrency, distributed systems and eventual consistency
Proficiency in Go, Java, C, C++ C# or other backend language
Demonstrated experience building solid, testable, and maintainable clean code

What is Amplemarket all about?
Amplemarket's premise is that a lot of the playbooks used by B2B sales teams that worked 5 years ago don't cut it anymore.
In today's environment, sales teams need to have a tremendous amount of information about their prospects to decide when is the best moment and channel to reach out in the most relevant way.

Frontend Engineer,$125K - $155K (Employer est.),"Who we are

The problem: Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.

About Pano: Pano is a venture-backed early-stage climate tech startup that is the leader in wildfire early detection, leveraging the latest advancements in IoT, AI, satellites, and SaaS software to deliver actionable intelligence to customers. Pano leverages mountaintop cameras and satellites to detect the first traces of smoke and put real-time fire images in the hands of asset owners and first responders to speed up containment. Pano is already partnering with major utilities, fire authorities, and government agencies in the USA and Australia.

Frontend Engineer,$125K - $155K (Employer est.),"Who we are

The problem: Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.

About Pano: Pano is a venture-backed early-stage climate tech startup that is the leader in wildfire early detection, leveraging the latest advancements in IoT, AI, satellites, and SaaS software to deliver actionable intelligence to customers. Pano leverages mountaintop cameras and satellites to detect the first traces of smoke and put real-time fire images in the hands of asset owners and first responders to speed up containment. Pano is already partnering with major utilities, fire authorities, and government agencies in the USA and Australia. Recent media coverage includes being named one of the Top 10 most innovative companies in AI of 2023 by FastCompany and recipient of the Innovative Mobile Service and Application Award at Mobile World Congress through our partnership with T-Mobile.

Pano brings together a diverse team bridging frontline, wildland firefighting experience with best-in-class know-how in operations, logistics, artificial intelligence, and software.

Founded in mid-2020, we’ve raised over $40M from leading VC funds.

The Role

The Frontend Engineer will strategize, design, and execute the user interface and experience for a single-page application dedicated to early wildfire detection. Responsibilities include collaborating closely with the product team to enhance map functionality, enhancing our custom canvas video player, and extending React application functionality. The engineer will deliver thoroughly tested, accessible solutions while adhering to best practices and ensuring cross-device compatibility.

Feature Development: Lead the development of new features, ensuring they align with project goals and enhance overall functionality.
Code Maintenance: Maintain and enhance existing codebase to optimize extensibility and address evolving requirements.
Code Review: Conduct thorough code reviews, providing constructive feedback to maintain code quality and adherence to best practices.
Code Quality Advocate: Championing the creation of readable code with predictable patterns to enhance collaboration and maintainability. Prioritize code quality by emphasizing accessibility principles, incorporating security best practices, and writing testable code.
Best Practices Evolution: Actively contribute to evolving coding standards and best practices within the development team.
Technology Evaluation: Participate in evaluating new technologies and tools, ensuring the adoption of effective solutions that align with project needs.
Tech Debt Prioritization: Collaborate in prioritizing and addressing technical debt to maintain a healthy and sustainable codebase.
Legacy Application Management: Successfully navigate and contribute to our existing application, striking a balance between addressing technical debt and delivering new features.
Expert Debugging Skills: Possess strong debugging capabilities to identify and resolve issues promptly, ensuring the stability and reliability of React applications.
REST API Integration: Proficient in utilizing RESTful APIs to facilitate smooth communication between the frontend and backend of React applications.
What you’ll bring
3-6 years of Frontend Engineer Experience: Demonstrate a robust background in developing Frontend applications, showcasing proficiency and expertise in creating efficient and scalable solutions.
Technical Proficiency: Experience with the following technologies HTML, CSS, Typescript, React, React Testing Library, Jest, and a state management solution like Redux (we use Recoil). Bonus points for HTML Canvas, or Map Technologies.
Design System and Component Library Proficiency: Proven expertise in utilizing Design Systems like Material Design and component libraries such as Material-UI, showcasing efficiency and consistency in development processes.
Effective Communication: Ability to communicate efficiently within the team, sharing insights and updates, and collaborating effectively to achieve project goals.
Cross-functional Team Experience: Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including QA, Product, and Backend, to plan and execute project initiatives.
Preference for someone in PST or MT time zone

JOB TITLE

Software Application Engineer I or II

JOB DESCRIPTION SUMMARY

As highly collaborative members of the DevOps Team in Information Technology Services, Software Application Engineers create and maintain software components within the University’s business application systems architecture. Software solutions developed typically involve inter-system integrations, complex processes, new functionality to extend an application’s capabilities, and advanced data manipulations and reporting functions. Software Application Engineers (SAEs) design, code, unit test, debug, document, implement, and maintain these programs and components in an organized software engineering environment based on agile development and deployment practices. The SAE has primary areas of responsibility within the applications architecture and technology stacks employed by the University but will also cross-train and serve as a backup to team SAEs in other application areas.

A secondary, but significant role of the Software Application Engineer is to work within the assigned applications environments to manage complex administration of the application. This includes responsibilities such as managing configuration controls, security configurations, and security assignments for the business application.
Software Application Engineers are classified as level I, II, or III depending on skills, experience, and qualifications. Higher-level SAEs perform more technical leadership within the DevOps team and have a higher level of design responsibilities for larger-scale projects.

Florida Poly’s business systems architecture includes Workday ERP, Ellucian Banner SaaS ERP, Salesforce, and Blackbaud core business systems as well as forty or more associated business applications. Technologies used by the DevOps team include (but are not limited to) MS SQL Server and Azure SQL, SSIS, SSRS, Team Foundation Server (TFS), PostgreSQL, TeamDynamix iPaaS, C# with MVC, REST APIs, XML, XSLT, and Cinchy Dataware. Platform-specific tools include Workday reporting, Workday Studio, Ellucian Insights, and Ellucian Ethos.

WHO WE ARE
Each year U.S. households spend over $3.8 trillion - about one third of all consumer spending - on recurring bill payments. While staying on top of these bills is the single largest determinant for consumer financial health, organizing and paying them can be a time-consuming and frustrating chore. Since its inception, doxo has been on a mission to simplify and reduce the anxiety of staying on top of bills, empowering consumers to improve their financial health. Our company was founded on the simple idea that there should be an easy and more secure way for consumers to pay all of their bills through a single account, with any payment method, on any device.
As consumers shift more bill payments online and to mobile, doxo continues to experience rapid growth. To date, over eight million doxo users across 97% of U.S. zip codes have paid bills through the payment network, across more than 45 different service categories. With more than 120,000 payable billers, doxo's proprietary, crowd sourced provider directory is the largest in the nation.

WHY WE ARE DIFFERENT
doxo is unique in that we have already found product/market fit and that our service is filling an important market need every day.

Because transparency is a priority at all levels across the organization, we are all aware of how our work contributes to the success of our business as a whole. We are agile and work hard to solve difficult problems quickly. We work as a team to get things done and mentor individuals to get to the next level in their career.

Follow internal processes for communicating current project progress, providing time line estimates, and estimating work orders. Work with clients through debugging and quality assurance cycles.
A typical week will include 4-5 stand up style meetings or other brief meeting formats to confirm internal status on projects; typically 1-2 phone meetings with clients to share updates and provide technical support if needed (our PM team runs the meetings 95% of the time); architecting or modifying an Enterprise C# based solution with projects for each customization/layer of the client's project; light work with a MS SQL database, creating LINQ or Entity Framework data layer, setting up back end business logic/workflows, wiring ASP.NET code to the back end workflows (much of the time this is now wiring Angular logic to back end workflows via Restful services - and primarily creating and validating those Restful services); testing completed features; debugging client trouble tickets; suggesting changes on all aspects of the company during a weekly review meeting; and a Friday team breakfast.
As Clarity continues to grow over the next 12-18 months we will be leveraging Client feedback and internal best practices to continue development of a standard code base we leverage for all our Client projects. In addition, Clarity will continue launching several new updates to our ecommerce and integration framework as well as further enhancing and releasing our business intelligence framework. We operate these product development teams in an scrum based agile model for internal development and for many of our client facing customization projects. This mix of internal and client facing projects enables team members to grow their skill set based on new client challenges while having a solid framework to consistently build and improve on throughout.

What is Amplemarket all about?
Amplemarket's premise is that a lot of the playbooks used by B2B sales teams that worked 5 years ago don't cut it anymore.
In today's environment, sales teams need to have a tremendous amount of information about their prospects to decide when is the best moment and channel to reach out in the most relevant way.

DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS
IT Software Engineer I is the entry-level class in the Software Engineer series. Software Engineers in this class are normally assigned to work on projects under the guidance of more experienced IT Software Engineers. Positions assigned to this class will generally perform more routine maintenance tasks of a less critical nature. This position will typically exercise less independent action and decision making.
IT Software Engineer II is the professional-level class in the IT Software Engineer series. The IT Software Engineer II is expected to perform duties associated with all prior position levels as necessary. Positions assigned to this classification are distinguished from the IT Software Engineer I by having demonstrated greater individual responsibility for software projects with less direct supervision. They will exhibit a proven record of accomplishment showing project management skills and/or successfully completed projects in which they lead or participated in a leadership role in their functional area. Solid project management skills are a necessity, as is an understanding of the various roles of project team members. Engineers in this class are also expected to participate in the mentoring and development of other IT Services staff in applications design and development and relevant topics. In addition, positions assigned to this class have responsibility for software and associated hardware procurements and IT planning, development and design.
Senior IT Software Engineer is the advanced professional class in the IT Software Engineer series. The Senior IT Software Engineer is expected to perform duties associated with all prior position levels as necessary. Positions assigned to this classification are distinguished from the lower classifications by the performance of more complex applications design and development projects and responsible tasks and by effectively utilizing their greater experience with little direct supervision. In addition, positions assigned to this class have generally assumed wider project management roles and/or specified software and associated hardware procurements for District-wide technical projects in any business unit. These positions will also assume more of a strategic and less of a tactical perspective with respect to Department planning efforts. They will exhibit a proven record of accomplishment showing project management skills and/or successfully completed projects in which they participated in a leadership role, and a thorough understanding of the various roles of project team members. They will also have demonstrated a high degree of participation in the mentoring and development of other IT Services staff. Also, in some cases, these individuals may assume a leadership role and direct the work of other IT Services staff as projects may dictate.

Jr. Front-End Developer,$52K - $91K (Glassdoor est.),"About You
Does this sound like you?
You have at least 1-2 years of your developer journey completed, and the most important thing to you about a new job is being surrounded by smart people.
You’ve worked on the same project long enough that you’re disappointed with a feature you built months ago (you can build it better now).
You're always looking for ways to improve the user experience with design and functionality.
You think asking questions or saying, “I don’t know” is a strength, not a weakness.
You’re wildly talented and can’t wait to share the knowledge you have or new tech you learned over a weekend.
You know Git, or at least you know how to pull, commit, fork and branch.
Collaboration is of utmost importance
You dabble in WordPress theme-ing or are a WordPress Developer.
You know Magento isn’t a color and aren’t afraid of XML layouts.
Development is a craft you are learning and hope to perform daily with integrity. Good simply isn’t good enough.
How did you know? That’s me!
Fantastic.
Here’s a bit more about the job.
Work with various development teams across the nation - and sometimes overseas
- to develop harder working websites using HTML, Sass and JS.
Work with MVC Frameworks in both PHP and .NET programming languages.
Use and develop for platforms like WordPress, Shopify, Kentico, nopCommerce, Magento and sometimes custom tailored CMSs.
All code you write will be tracked with Git and you’ll be responsible for your part in a feature-branch workflow.
For platforms like Kentico and WordPress, you will support backend teams in developing plugins or extensions to fit project requirements.
You’ll use Figma and Adobe Suite to edit/modify/optimize images and break apart PSD designs into HTML/CSS/JS and integrate with aforementioned frameworks.
Your day-to-day will include working on multiple client projects at a time. Some from scratch and others from existing projects that need maintenance or feature updates.
You will manage your own tasks and queue of work given to you by the project management team or customer support.
You’ll estimate work, brainstorming strategy, and creating proof-of-concepts for new business.
GoldenComm is all for sharing knowledge. From time to time you might give a presentation on tech, code patterns or strategies to your team.

Software Engineer – Frontend,$105K - $169K (Glassdoor est.),"Padlet is building software for a good education. A good education is one that inspires curiosity, creativity, and community. Our software enables that through visual content creation and collaboration in millions of classrooms worldwide.

Think of an exceptional product, say the Dyson vacuum cleaner or WD40. What makes it exceptional is that not only does it perform its function well, it makes you feel great using it. It almost makes you want to have more problems so you could use the product more.
We want Padlet to be an exceptional product. We are looking for Frontend Engineers to improve our web apps and delight a billion people.
Responsibilities
Building new features. E.g. creating beautiful slideshows in Padlet.
Creating delight. E.g. through animations and micro UI.
Making the web apps faster. E.g. reducing javascript payload.
Improving how we work. E.g. improving our component library or tools we use to translate the web app into 40+ languages.
Qualifications
At some point in your life, someone has told you: “you write good code.”
You know how to copy-paste code from Stack Overflow.
About Padlet
Vision: Every child in the world will grow up with Mickey Mouse and Padlet.
Product: We are making the default way of collecting and sharing thoughts on the Internet. People love the product.
Impact: We have over 50 million active users making Padlet one of the most used apps on the planet. Our goal is to be THE the most used app on the planet.
Money: We are venture backed AND profitable. We are built to last one hundred years.
Badassery: We are 36 people (plus a baby crane that we've adopted but it doesn't really do much). That's over a million active users per employee. Some badass people work here.
Tech stack
Web: VueJS, Tailwind.
Mobile apps: React Native (with Swift and Java where necessary.)
Backend: Ruby (Rails), Typescript, Elixir (Phoenix), and Python.
Storage: Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, Firestore, and Snowflake.
Joys of engineering at Padlet
We have very few meetings. We value keeping you in flow.
A lot of people use Padlet. We have to solve interesting real-time collaboration problems.
Our users are in over 200 countries, using all kinds of devices and connections, and speaking over 40 languages. We have to solve interesting internationalization problems.
We like to craft delightful user experiences. They’re satisfying to build.
We try to solve problems creatively instead of just throwing money at them. We are engineers! We thrive in constraints, not in the absence of them.
We ship often.
We value beautiful code.
Sorrows of engineering at Padlet
We grew pretty fast last year and our processes are still catching up. E.g. we don't have 100% code coverage yet. Our deployment process isn't as painless as it could be. This sometimes leads to spending time on things that aren't the most fun. We’re working on it!
Our project management process could be better. This sometimes leads to re-speccing in the middle of development, getting in the way of programming flow. We’re working on it!
Some people you‘d be working with
Josh Hewitt: insists that wallabies and kangaroos are different animals, artificially inflating the biodiversity of his homeland. Is excellent at surgically improving an existing, complicated system.
Colin Teahan: lives for one-liners. E.g: Colleague: “Wouldn’t it be funny if Iron Man were anemic?” Teahan: “It would be IRONIC.” Single-handedly wrote early versions of our iOS and Android apps.
The office
Our office is in the middle of Presidio, a beautiful national park. We’re 5 minutes from the beach, a walk we take often. The WiFi works outdoors. You can work sitting in a lawn overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge.
The office itself is designed to be a space for all your interests and hobbies. We have a meditation room, game room, library, podcasting studio, art studio, kids room, and full makerspace with 3d printers, presses, laser cutters, sewing machines, and more.

The Role

We are seeking an ambitious and effective Full Stack Software Engineer who has experience independently executing complex projects and building scalable, maintainable software. As a purveyor of a developer platform used in the practice of medicine, we are diligent about process efficiency and code quality but know that we cannot deliver value without shipping product.

In the process of shipping new capabilities and addressing defects, you have developed an understanding of the underlying data models and how the tech stack works together to deliver user experiences. You ensure that your pull requests are high quality because you include the appropriate test coverage and documentation which is grounded in understanding of product requirements, user behavior, and system design.
Responsibilities:
Design and build novel products and features to address long-standing problems in healthcare, with a focus on producing amazing experiences that are more than the sum of their parts.
Collaborate with product, design, and other departments to create cutting-edge user interfaces, experiences and interactions.
Improve the quality, reliability, and speed of our core products and services.
Propose and implement changes to our data models, core architecture, and codebase as necessary to achieve your products and teams objectives.

Independently shipping production-quality code with an eye towards usability, performance, and extensibility.
Maintaining customer empathy and a customer-focused engineering mindset.
Building and maintaining automated testing on your contributions to the product.
Qualifications:
Significant professional experience in building and maintaining consumer grade web applications with 4+ years experience.

We help people work smarter.
Okay, so that’s pretty broad (and ambitious!). We’re starting our journey with something a lot more specific — helping B2B sales teams focus on the most impactful things to work on.
Our innovative tech gives clients a comprehensive, real-time picture of their sales pipeline, pinpoints the biggest risks and recommends the best ways to mitigate them.

What’s it like to work at Nektar?
True to our mission, our culture prioritizes working smart. We’re about focusing on the things that make the biggest impact and doing them well. We’re constantly looking for ways to improve the way we work.
Team members also enjoy a huge, perhaps shocking, degree of autonomy. We trust each person to define the details of what they do and to figure out how to do it. That’s not to say we work in silos — quite the opposite: we all collaborate closely across functions and get to wear many hats.
As an all-remote company, we’re very flexible with respect to time and place of work. We prefer asynchronous communication, and keep meetings to a minimum.


We’re looking for engineers who can hit the ground running, with at least a year’s experience building production servers using Node.js.
Experience with the frontend is positive but not required.
As an all-remote team, we require great communication skills, particularly in writing.

"Software Engineer, Backend",$130K - $250K (Employer est.),"About Us:
We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
About The Role:
Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means millions of people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion.
What You'll Achieve:
You’ll partner with engineering leaders to identify and execute against high leverage technical investment that ensure the long-term flexibility and sustainability of our core systems.
You’ll contribute to the overall performance, reliability, and robustness of Notion databases, ensuring they scale elegantly to larger datasets and workloads.
Skills and Toolset You'll Need to Bring:
Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
Ability to scale: You have experience scaling production software to support rapid growth, or you're motivated and excited to learn.
Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.
Nice to Haves:
You have experience working with distributed systems.
You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, Memcached, Postgres, Docker, and Elasticsearch.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
